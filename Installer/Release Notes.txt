Known Issues
--------------------
* All Windows - Selecting SQL Editor from a MySQL service that doesn't have a Workbench connection opens Workbench in the home screen.
  Workaround: Create a local connection in Workbench with the MySQL service used in the Notifier so the SQL Editor could use this connection.
* Windows XP - The Scheduled Task created by the Notifier to Check for Updates does not have valid credentials and cannot be run.
  Workaround: Update the "MySQLNotifierTask" in Windows XP with some valid credentials.
