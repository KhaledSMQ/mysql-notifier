1.1.2
Fixed code to enable the SQL Editor menu when MySQL Workbench is installed and it supports opening the SQL Editor from the command line and the bound
service contains Workbench connections, otherwise disable it. The SQL Editor menu opens Workbench directly if only 1 connection exists and the menu is
disabled if there are none. (Bug #14332402 - CLICKING "SQL EDITOR" DOESN'T ACTUALLY OPEN SQL EDITOR IN WB)
