1.1.6
- Added extra condition to handle the case where the my.ini file doesn't exist so no High Severity Exception error is thrown.
  (MySQL Bug #73539, Bug #19422802 HIGH SEVERITY ERROR IF SERVER\'S MY.INI FILE IS DELETED)
- Added further validation to ensure only true MySQL services are added to the watched list.
  (MySQL Bug #73135, Bug #19078684 - MYSQL NOTIFIER OPENS AND GIVES AN ERROR MESSAGE "HIGH SEVERITY ERROR")
- Fixed error that prevented notifier from showing the balloon when updates are available.
  (Bug #19219905 - FAILS TO SHOW UPDATES WHEN UPDATES ARE AVAILABLE)
- Fixed code that detected changes in the Workbench connections file to clear connections before attempting to load them again from disk.
  (Bug #18163378 - REMOVED CONNECTIONS NOT DETECTED FOR SQL EDITOR...)
- Added error handling code during the check for updates process. If the user cancels the UAC prompt (since the check for updates process requires
  elevation) that is treated as an error, all errors are properly sent to the application log now.
  (Bug #17858917 - IN CHECK FOR UPDATES. IF CLICK "CANCEL" ON UAC, RAISE AN "HIGH SEVERITY ERROR")

1.1.5
- Changed the way the Workbench connections and servers files are monitored, now the Notifier detects automatically when Workbench is installed or
  uninstalled and starts or stops monitoring its files on those events so the Notifier does not need to be restarted to setup the monitoring of the
  files.
- Fixed code that attempted to reflect changes done to a connection being used by a monitored MySQL Instance after adding new Workbench connections.
  (Bug #17697914 - CHECK ADD INSTANCE LIST AND CLICK "CANCEL", RAISE ERROR)
- Added code to refresh MySQL instances when the Notifier is loading so if Workbench was uninstalled and there were instances pointing to now invalid
  connections, they are removed and the menu items do not appear empty.
  (Bug #17671410 - NOTIFIER DOES NOT UPDATE INSTANCES EXISTED IN WORKBENCH WHEN REMOVING WORKBENCH)
- Added Workbench connections edition capability right from the Monitor MySQL Server Instance window of the MySQL Notifier (accessed through Actions
  > Manage Monitored Items… > Add… > MySQL Instance). Any of the listed MySQL Workbench connections can be right-clicked and a new “Edit
  Connection” context menu is available for users to edit the Workbench connection properties.
- Fixed a problem in which MySQL Service menu options (Configure Instance and SQL Editor submenus) were not refreshed correctly when the Workbench
  connections tied to them were changed on MySQL Workbench.
- Simplified method signatures at MySQL.Utility and updated every call to them at notifier. Moved method call to create the schedule task properly.
  (Bug #14388579 - SCHEDULED TASK TO CHECK FOR UPDATES DOESN'T START IN XP)
- Removed AssemblyInfo.cs from Notifier since this class is now shared from Utility dll.
- When the user deletes the .ini file for any server at c:\ProgramData\MySQL Server 5.X\ and somewhat the services is not deleted when uninstalling that
  server, it causes the app to crash. This fix adds an additional check to verify such .ini files exist before attempting to get some values out of them.
  (Bug #17432516 - MYSQL NOTIFIER OPENS AND GIVES AN ERROR MESSAGE "HIGH SEVERITY ERROR")

1.1.4
- Fixed code to auto launch notifier right after installing it. (Bug #16927045 - AUTOSTART NOTIFIER AFTER SUCCESSFULL INSTALLATION)
- Corrected code to set the registry key to start Notifier along with Windows. (MySQL bug #69279, Bug #16832752 - MYSQL NOTIFIER: DOES NOT START WITH WINDOWS, 
  INCORRECT SETTING WITHIN REGISTER.)
  (Bug #14400738 - RUN AT WINDOWS STARTUP OPTION IS NOT WORKING)
- Fixed code to automatically add matching services. (MySql bug #67617, Bug #15887501 - MySQL Notifier autofilter not auto finding running services)
  (Bug#16660623 - NOTIFIER IS NOT LISTING THE JUST INSTALLED SERVER INSTANCE)
  (Bug#14345177 - NEW SERVICE IS NOT ADDED TO NOTIFIER)
- Fixed the SQL Editor menu to be enabled if there is only1 connection related to the current service, if there are no connections the menu item is disabled.
  (Bug#14332402 - CLICKING "SQL EDITOR" DOESN'T ACTUALLY OPEN SQL EDITOR IN WB)
- Added a custom action to the WIX project to send a WM_CLOSE message to the Notifier at uninstall time, for it to catch it and close.
  (Bug#16661468 - NOTIFIER PROCESS/APPLICATION IS STILL RUNNING AFTER UNINSTALL.)

1.1.2
- From now on if you have the AutoAddServicesToMonitor option checked and you add a new service which Name matches the filter ("mysql") in a monitored 
  machine (localhost is monitored by default) it will be automatically added to the list of monitored services.
  (MySql bug #67617, Bug #15887501 - MYSQL NOTIFIER AUTOFILTER NOT AUTO FINDING RUNNING SERVICES)
  (Bug#16660623 - NOTIFIER IS NOT LISTING THE JUST INSTALLED SERVER INSTANCE.)
  (Bug#14345177 - NEW SERVICE IS NOT ADDED TO NOTIFIER)
- Fixed code to enable the SQL Editor menu when MySQL Workbench is installed and it supports opening the SQL Editor from the command line and the bound
  service contains Workbench connections, otherwise disable it. The SQL Editor menu opens Workbench directly if only 1 connection exists and the menu is
  disabled if there are none. (Bug #14332402 - CLICKING "SQL EDITOR" DOESN'T ACTUALLY OPEN SQL EDITOR IN WB)
