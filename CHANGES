- From now on if you have the AutoAddServicesToMonitor option checked and you add a new service which Name matches the filter ("mysql") in a monitored 
  machine (localhost is monitored by default) it will be automatically added to the list of monitored services.
  (MySql bug #67617, Bug #15887501 - MYSQL NOTIFIER AUTOFILTER NOT AUTO FINDING RUNNING SERVICES)
  (Bug#16660623 - NOTIFIER IS NOT LISTING THE JUST INSTALLED SERVER INSTANCE.)
  (Bug#14345177 - NEW SERVICE IS NOT ADDED TO NOTIFIER)
- Fixed code to enable the SQL Editor menu when MySQL Workbench is installed and it supports opening the SQL Editor from the command line and the bound
  service contains Workbench connections, otherwise disable it. The SQL Editor menu opens Workbench directly if only 1 connection exists and the menu is
  disabled if there are none. (Bug #14332402 - CLICKING "SQL EDITOR" DOESN'T ACTUALLY OPEN SQL EDITOR IN WB)
